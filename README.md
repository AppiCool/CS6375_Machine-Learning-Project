# CS6375_Machine-Learning-Project
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the flight fare prices based on various features such as departure and arrival locations, dates of travel, number of stops, airline, and other relevant factors. The model should be able to analyze historical flight data and predict the prices for future flights with a high degree of accuracy. The main objective is to create a tool that can help travelers plan their trips and find the best flight deals, while also assisting airlines in optimizing their pricing strategies.
We have used different types of Machine Learning Models to calculate and compare accuracies for this project. We are comparing accuracies both before and after optimisation. To further increase accuarcy we have used boosting techniques.
Please read "CS6375_FinalProject_Report.pdf" to get gist of our work. It includes the result obtained and also discussion on why one machine learning model is better than others for this problem set.
